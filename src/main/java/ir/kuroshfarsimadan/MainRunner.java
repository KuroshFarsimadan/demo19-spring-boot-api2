 * https://spring.io/guides/gs/spring-boot/
 * @SpringBootApplication is a convenience annotation that adds all of the following:
 * @Configuration tags the class as a source of bean definitions for the application context.
 * @EnableAutoConfiguration tells Spring Boot to start adding beans based on classpath settings, other beans, and various property settings.
 * Normally you would add @EnableWebMvc for a Spring MVC app, but Spring Boot adds it automatically when it sees spring-webmvc on the classpath. 
 * This flags the application as a web application and activates key behaviors such as setting up a DispatcherServlet.
 * @ComponentScan tells Spring to look for other components, configurations, and services in the hello package, allowing it to find the controllers.
